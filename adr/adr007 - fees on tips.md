## Context

Why 2% fee on tips


## Alternative Approaches

### No Fee

### Higher fee

We could just increase that 2% fee to something like 5 or 10%.  Although this could be a solution, limiting that fee is important because it supports having on-chain tips (can be tracked for governance/ usage purposes) vs off-chain.
