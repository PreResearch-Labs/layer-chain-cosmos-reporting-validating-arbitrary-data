- 2024-02-21: initial version

## Context

Currently base (inflationary) rewards are split between reporters and validators on a 75/25 split.  75 percent of the inflationary reward (~3000 TRB/month) is given to reporters of the cycle list, proportionally to their reporting stake used in each aggregated query.  25 percent of the reward (~1000 TRB/month) is given to the validators as their base reward.  


## Alternative Approaches

### All base reward given to validators

### All rewards given to reporters

### Adding in relaying


## Issues / Notes on Implementation
